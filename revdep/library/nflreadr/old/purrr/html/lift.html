<h2>Lift the domain of a function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>lift_xy()</code> is a composition helper. It helps you compose
functions by lifting their domain from a kind of input to another
kind. The domain can be changed from and to a list (l), a vector
(v) and dots (d). For example, <code>lift_ld(fun)</code> transforms a
function taking a list to a function taking dots.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
lift(..f, ..., .unnamed = FALSE)

lift_dl(..f, ..., .unnamed = FALSE)

lift_dv(..f, ..., .unnamed = FALSE)

lift_vl(..f, ..., .type)

lift_vd(..f, ..., .type)

lift_ld(..f, ...)

lift_lv(..f, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>..f</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function to lift.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default arguments for <code>..f</code>. These will be
evaluated only once, when the lifting factory is called.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.unnamed</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, <code>ld</code> or <code>lv</code> will not
name the parameters in the lifted function signature. This
prevents matching of arguments by name and match by position
instead.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector mold or a string describing the type of the
input vectors. The latter can be any of the types returned by
<code><a href="../../base/html/typeof.html">typeof()</a></code>, or &quot;numeric&quot; as a shorthand for either
&quot;double&quot; or &quot;integer&quot;.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The most important of those helpers is probably <code>lift_dl()</code>
because it allows you to transform a regular function to one that
takes a list. This is often essential for composition with purrr
functional tools. Since this is such a common function,
<code>lift()</code> is provided as an alias for that operation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function.
</p>


<h3>from ... to <code>list(...)</code> or <code>c(...)</code></h3>

<p>Here dots should be taken here in a figurative way. The lifted
functions does not need to take dots per se. The function is
simply wrapped a function in <code><a href="../../base/html/do.call.html">do.call()</a></code>, so instead
of taking multiple arguments, it takes a single named list or
vector which will be interpreted as its arguments.  This is
particularly useful when you want to pass a row of a data frame
or a list to a function and don't want to manually pull it apart
in your function.
</p>


<h3>from <code>c(...)</code> to <code>list(...)</code> or <code>...</code></h3>

<p>These factories allow a function taking a vector to take a list
or dots instead. The lifted function internally transforms its
inputs back to an atomic vector. purrr does not obey the usual R
casting rules (e.g., <code>c(1, "2")</code> produces a character
vector) and will produce an error if the types are not
compatible. Additionally, you can enforce a particular vector
type by supplying <code>.type</code>.
</p>


<h3>from list(...) to c(...) or ...</h3>

<p><code>lift_ld()</code> turns a function that takes a list into a
function that takes dots. <code>lift_vd()</code> does the same with a
function that takes an atomic vector. These factory functions are
the inverse operations of <code>lift_dl()</code> and <code>lift_dv()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>lift_vd()</code> internally coerces the inputs of <code>..f</code> to
an atomic vector. The details of this coercion can be controlled
with <code>.type</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
### Lifting from ... to list(...) or c(...)

x &lt;- list(x = c(1:100, NA, 1000), na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.9)
lift_dl(mean)(x)

# Or in a pipe:
mean %&gt;% lift_dl() %&gt;% invoke(x)

# You can also use the lift() alias for this common operation:
lift(mean)(x)

# Default arguments can also be specified directly in lift_dl()
list(c(1:100, NA, 1000)) %&gt;% lift_dl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)()

# lift_dl() and lift_ld() are inverse of each other.
# Here we transform sum() so that it takes a list
fun &lt;- sum %&gt;% lift_dl()
fun(list(3, NA, 4, na.rm = TRUE))

# Now we transform it back to a variadic function
fun2 &lt;- fun %&gt;% lift_ld()
fun2(3, NA, 4, na.rm = TRUE)

# It can sometimes be useful to make sure the lifted function's
# signature has no named parameters, as would be the case for a
# function taking only dots. The lifted function will take a list
# or vector but will not match its arguments to the names of the
# input. For instance, if you give a data frame as input to your
# lifted function, the names of the columns are probably not
# related to the function signature and should be discarded.
lifted_identical &lt;- lift_dl(identical, .unnamed = TRUE)
mtcars[c(1, 1)] %&gt;% lifted_identical()
mtcars[c(1, 2)] %&gt;% lifted_identical()
#


### Lifting from c(...) to list(...) or ...

# In other situations we need the vector-valued function to take a
# variable number of arguments as with pmap(). This is a job for
# lift_vd():
pmap(mtcars, lift_vd(mean))

# lift_vd() will collect the arguments and concatenate them to a
# vector before passing them to ..f. You can add a check to assert
# the type of vector you expect:
lift_vd(tolower, .type = character(1))("this", "is", "ok")
#


### Lifting from list(...) to c(...) or ...

# cross() normally takes a list of elements and returns their
# cartesian product. By lifting it you can supply the arguments as
# if it was a function taking dots:
cross_dots &lt;- lift_ld(cross)
out1 &lt;- cross(list(a = 1:2, b = c("a", "b", "c")))
out2 &lt;- cross_dots(a = 1:2, b = c("a", "b", "c"))
identical(out1, out2)

# This kind of lifting is sometimes needed for function
# composition. An example would be to use pmap() with a function
# that takes a list. In the following, we use some() on each row of
# a data frame to check they each contain at least one element
# satisfying a condition:
mtcars %&gt;% pmap(lift_ld(some, partial(`&lt;`, 200)))

# Default arguments for ..f can be specified in the call to
# lift_ld()
lift_ld(cross, .filter = `==`)(1:3, 1:3) %&gt;% str()


# Here is another function taking a list and that we can update to
# take a vector:
glue &lt;- function(l) {
  if (!is.list(l)) stop("not a list")
  l %&gt;% invoke(paste, .)
}

## Not run: 
letters %&gt;% glue()           # fails because glue() expects a list
## End(Not run)

letters %&gt;% lift_lv(glue)()  # succeeds
