# nflreadr 1.1.0

This release makes some backend changes for speed, reduced dependency footprint, and ease of maintenance. 

## New Data

- `load_player_stats()` can now retrieve weekly summaries of kicking data by specifying the `stat_type` argument to be `"kicking"`.
- `load_combine()` retrieves NFL combine data (from PFR).

## Backend Changes

- Remove progress handling from `*_from_url()` family of functions and move responsibility to `progressively()` function decorator instead. See vignette for details.
- Removed dependency on `dplyr` and `purrr` in favour of `data.table` - this hopefully improves speed and reduces the dependency footprint.
- Uses `rlang::arg_match0` instead of match.arg (uses rlang explicitly instead of implicitly as a dependency of memoise).

# nflreadr 1.0.0

The goal of {`nflreadr`} is to efficiently load data from [nflverse GitHub repositories](https://github.com/nflverse), and features caching, optional progress updates, and data dictionaries.

At this time, it includes data from the following repositories:

- [nflverse/nflfastR-data](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data)
- [nflverse/nfldata](https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata)
- [nflverse/nflfastR-roster](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-roster)
- [nflverse/espnscrapeR-data](https://github.com/nflverse/espnscrapeR-data)
- [nflverse/pfr_scrapR](https://github.com/nflverse/pfr_scrapR)
- [dynastyprocess/data](https://github.com/dynastyprocess/data)

This will hopefully provide a unified and reliable package for downloading nflverse data that can be extended to the rest of the nflverse and ffverse package families.

Special thanks to Seb, Ben, John, Lee, and Thomas for their contributions to the package and to the data pipelines that this package relies on ðŸŽ‰
