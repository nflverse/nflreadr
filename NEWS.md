- `load_contracts()` downloads (historical) player contracts from [OverTheCap.com](https://overthecap.com/contract-history/)
- `download_nflverse()` downloads all files attached to specified/all releases to a local folder. (v1.2.0.05) - requires dev version of piggyback atm.

- `load_from_url()` exposes a new utility function for loading any csv, rds, qs, parquet URL to memory. (v1.2.0.16)

## fixes
- moved rbindlist to a helper that manages attributes better (v1.2.0.01)
- update `dictionary_snap_counts` and `dictionary_schedules` with some missing fields (v1.2.0.02)

- bump minimum rlang version to 1.0.0
- add piggyback suggested dependency
- Export old class to support S4/DBI/`nflfastR::update_db()` as if it were a tibble. (v1.2.0.06)
- Fix exportOldClass so that it supports only data.frame stuff? we have no idea,,, (v1.2.0.08)
- `options(nflreadr.prefer)` defaults to rds now since qs is no longer a required dependency. (v1.2.0.09)
- `clean_player_names()` now also removes commas (after optionally using them for `convert_lastfirst`) (v1.2.0.12)
- `clean_player_names()` now also removes all caps suffixes (v1.2.0.13)
- dictionary updates: return labelled.
- `.sitrep()` exits nicely if no packages are to be investigated. #114 (v1.2.0.15)

# nflreadr 1.2.0

This release updates all nflverse URLs to use the new [nflverse-data repository](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data) releases, as well as provides improved pretty-printing methods that tell you when the data was last updated. 

---


# nflreadr 1.1.3

This release adds functions and arguments to access new data, along with some backend changes. 

## New data and functions

- `load_ff_opportunity()` downloads expected fantasy points data from the [ffopportunity package](https://ffopportunity.ffverse.com)
- `load_ff_rankings()` gains an `"all"` parameter to return all available rankings data (weekly archives since 2019)
- `load_pfr_advstats()` gains a `"summary_level"` parameter to return season-level data, which has some fields that are not available at the week-level. 

## Backend

- `options(nflreadr.verbose)` replaces `options(nflreadr.cache_warning)` as the best way to silence nflreadr messages.
- Improved data dictionaries for ESPN QBR, Injuries, Trades, Depth Charts, and Combine
- Exported `most_recent_season()` function
- Updated documentation with improved linking and where to file data issues.
- Sitrep functions have ffopportunity and nflverse packages.
- Pkgdown site upgraded to Bootstrap 5.

# nflreadr 1.1.2

## New Functions

- `nflverse_sitrep()` and `ffverse_sitrep()` give a minimal overview of the package dependencies
- Minimum R version bumped to R 3.6.0 - this is the minimum version required to read the [current RDS file-version](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/readRDS.html). 
- `_sitrep()` functions receive a small print-related bugfix and colouring improvement.

---

# nflreadr 1.1.1

## New Data and Functions
- `clean_player_names()` and `clean_team_abbrs()` added - these help standardise player names and team abbreviations based on internal dictionaries. 
- `load_ff_rankings()` now has a `type` argument and can return `"draft"` or `"week"` rankings from the DynastyProcess/data repo.
- `clean_homeaway()` converts a dataframe of games with columns prefixed with `home_` and `away_` to a dataframe of teams, renaming to `team_` and `opponent_` and doubling the rows.
- Added `load_pfr_advstats()` which provides pass, rush, rec, def additional data for each week.

## Bug Fixes

- Add Rcpp and RcppParallel minimum dependencies to fix qs issues.
- Added a message that reminds the user of the caching behavior. The message will be displayed once every 8 hours if the session is interactive.
- Adjusted file location of snap count data

# nflreadr 1.1.0

This release makes some backend changes for speed, reduced dependency footprint, and ease of maintenance. 

## New Data

- `load_player_stats()` can now retrieve weekly summaries of kicking data by specifying the `stat_type` argument to be `"kicking"`.
- `load_combine()` retrieves NFL combine data (from PFR).

## Backend Changes

- Remove progress handling from `*_from_url()` family of functions and move responsibility to `progressively()` function decorator instead. See vignette for details.
- Removed dependency on `dplyr` and `purrr` in favour of `data.table` - this hopefully improves speed and reduces the dependency footprint.
- Uses `rlang::arg_match0` instead of match.arg (uses rlang explicitly instead of implicitly as a dependency of memoise).

# nflreadr 1.0.0

The goal of {`nflreadr`} is to efficiently load data from [nflverse GitHub repositories](https://github.com/nflverse), and features caching, optional progress updates, and data dictionaries.

At this time, it includes data from the following repositories:

- [nflverse/nflfastR-data](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data)
- [nflverse/nfldata](https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata)
- [nflverse/nflfastR-roster](https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-roster)
- [nflverse/espnscrapeR-data](https://github.com/nflverse/espnscrapeR-data)
- [nflverse/pfr_scrapR](https://github.com/nflverse/pfr_scrapR)
- [dynastyprocess/data](https://github.com/dynastyprocess/data)

This will hopefully provide a unified and reliable package for downloading nflverse data that can be extended to the rest of the nflverse and ffverse package families.

Special thanks to Seb, Ben, John, Lee, and Thomas for their contributions to the package and to the data pipelines that this package relies on ðŸŽ‰
